K- means becomes handy when dataset is large whereas Hierarchial clustering inefficient in this regard because it becomes computationally expensive . Time complexity is very high in case of hierarchial clustering as each data point has been considered as one single cluster to start off and then based on the euclidian distance with other data points the membership of  the big cluster has been obtained. Whereas in K means , based on the K, the membership of the cluster  is obtained following the centroid movement . Time complexity_k-means : order of n o(n) , hierarchial : o(n2).
